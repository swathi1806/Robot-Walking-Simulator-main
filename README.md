# Robot Walking Simulator 

## Introduction

The Robot Walking Simulator is an interactive program designed to simulate a robot's 
movement and orientation based on user commands. The robot starts at the origin (0, 0) 
facing north and can move forward, turn left, or turn right according to the user's inputs. 
As the user commands the robot to move, the simulator updates the robot's position and 
orientation in real-time, providing immediate feedback. The simulation continues until the 
user issues a "stop" command, at which point the final position and orientation of the robot 
are displayed.

Preprocessor Directives & Definitions

The #define statements enable various features like SPHERE, COLOR, LIGHT, etc.
Defines constants for robot parts, like torso, hip, arms, legs, etc.
OpenGL & GLUT Libraries

Uses GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) to create and manage the graphical display.
Includes GLUquadricObj *qobj for handling 3D quadric shapes.
3D Robot Model

The robot is constructed using display lists, defining body parts like:
Torso
Hip
Shoulders
Arms & Legs
Feet & Rocket Pod
Uses functions to render geometric shapes (boxes, octagons, cylinders, and spheres).
Motion Variables & Animations

Defines angles for various joints to animate movement.
Functions like RaiseLeg1Forward() and Elbow1Add() control limb movement.
animation_walk() function moves legs in a walking motion.
Lighting & Materials

Uses GL_LIGHTING to add illumination.
Different materials & colors are applied to parts like the torso, hip, and arms.
Keyboard & Mouse Controls

keyboard() function maps keys to robot movement.
Uses arrow keys to rotate the scene and letter keys to move arms, legs, and torso.
GLUT Menu

Right-click opens a menu to:
Start/stop walking animation.
Toggle wireframe mode.
Move different robot parts.
Main Function (main())

Initializes GLUT window (size: 1000x1000).
Registers display, reshape, keyboard, and menu functions.
Runs glutMainLoop() to keep rendering the simulation.
Summary
This program renders a 3D robot that can walk and move its limbs using OpenGL and GLUT. It includes lighting, animations, and interactive controls to simulate realistic movement. ðŸš€ðŸ¤–
